## Opening an issue
If you provide one or more of the stuff listed below, it'll be a lot faster for me and future fellow contributors to help you

- Affected source code. It's best for you to create minimal source code that could reproduce the issue
- LLVM's Logs in Debug mode if the issue is about crashed compiling process
- Misbehaving passes. Try toggling pass switches to find out what pass(es) is triggering the issue
- Details regarding the target platform
